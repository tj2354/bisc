## Supporting Codes for Our Submission:
Stable, chronic in-vivo recordings from a fully wireless subdural-contained 65,536-electrode brain-computer interface device

## Overview

Each of the four directories contains analysis code and data pertaining to topics as outlined below.
Each directory has its own instructions on installation requirements and how to execute the codes.

All analyses are based on Python framework.

Refer to the directory ```bisc_invitro_porcine_motor_cortex``` for analysis on the following topics:
- In vitro characterization (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S26)
- Porcine SSEP recordings (Fig. 2)
- NHP motor cortex recordings (Fig. 3)

Refer to the directory ```bisc_visual_cortex_dot_grating``` for analysis on the following topics:
- NHP visual cortex recordings with grating stimuli (Fig. 4)
- NHP visual cortex recordings with dot stimuli; analysis based on LFP power (Fig. 5)

Refer to the directory ```bisc_visual_cortex_traveling_wave``` for analysis on the following topics:
- NHP visual cortex recordings with dot stimuli; analysis based on traveling waves (Fig. 6)

Refer to the directory ```bisc_visual_cortex_natural_image``` for analysis on the following topics:
- NHP visual cortex recordings with natural image stimuli (Extended Data Fig. 2)

Data required for running the scripts are available in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17074065) (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17074064).
